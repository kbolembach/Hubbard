# Hubbard

Implementation of the Hubbard model for arbitrary number of dimensions, with a rectangular lattice. You can either run `hubbard_lanczos_script.jl` with arguments or you can use the Jupyter notebooks `hubbard_ED.ipynb` with exact diagonalizations of matrices (fit for smaller lattices) or `hubbard_lanczos.ipynb` which uses the Lanczos diagonalization algorithm.
